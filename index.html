        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The thing that I love the most will always be web development, and for that very reason I still a little bit hessitant into making it a creer, since I would like to study and practice web development for the love of it. In the meantime, I work as database programmer and designer which is the thing I love, but I am not very passionate about.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, I am getting a better and better designer every day, since I am lerning to see things. Howevever, I am not sure that I will ever be able to master design.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>In time I want to master as much of web development as possible, but for now I would like to focus on increasing my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The next step after that would be various web development frameworks. I would like to first learn how frameworks work under the surface by learning web development languages.</p>
